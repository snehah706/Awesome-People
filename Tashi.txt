Tashi is my three year old dog. She is a shih tzu who is a picky eater, but loves carrots. Her favorite time of the day is evenings when she plays and gets her treats. She hates to go on walks, especially during the rains. Her favorite way to pass the time is looking over the balcony and judging the things going outside. Her recent favorite toy is a squirrel (only one among the many she isn't too small for or isn't scared of).
